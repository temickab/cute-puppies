## Cute Puppies
- This just just a bootstrap3 style website that I created using bootstrap studio, and then exporting it and doing further editing. 
- The website was originally a site I did for a client that owned a gun shop but I decided to change it around to make it look like cute puppies since the website is no longer needed. 
- So when you take a look at the code and see words like, "ammo" and "guns" it's because I am still editing and changing things around.
 - Enjoy
